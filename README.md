# CONFIG

This repository contains my configuration files that do not include
personal information. Please take a look at the file contents before
starting using it. **I do not guarantee anything.**

Emacs configuration has been moved to a separate
[repository](https://git.gokmengorgen.net/goedev/emacs.d).


## INSTALLATION

Install [dosh](https://git.gokmengorgen.net/goedev/dosh) first, then:

```shell
$ dosh help
```

Dosh will guide you on how to install configuration files.
